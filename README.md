# PRODIGY_WD_03
Tic-Tac-Toe Web application 
🎮 Project Title: Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application | Task-03
🏢 Organization: ProDigy Infotech Internship
📌 Project Description:
This project is part of Task-03 from the ProDigy Infotech Internship Program. The goal is to build a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows two players to take turns placing Xs and Os on a 3×3 grid, aiming to line up three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

You’ll use:

HTML for structure

CSS for design (including a clean, gradient-styled circular layout)

JavaScript for interactive logic

🌐 Technologies Used:
HTML5 – Layout of the game board

CSS3 – Styling with gradients and responsive layout

JavaScript (Vanilla) – Game mechanics and logic

✨ Features:
✅ 3×3 Grid Board

✅ Alternating turns (Player X / Player O)

✅ Win detection (row, column, diagonal)

✅ Draw detection

✅ Game reset button

✅ Minimalist UI with gradient styling

🧠 How It Works:
The game board is a 3x3 HTML grid.

JavaScript tracks turns and checks win conditions after each move.

The board locks if someone wins or the game ends in a draw.

Players can click "Restart Game" to play again.

🎨 Design:
Circular buttons with gradient backgrounds

Clean interface using monoline icons

Responsive layout for all screen sizes
